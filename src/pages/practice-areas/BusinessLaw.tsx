              Why Business Formation Matters
            </Typography>

            <Typography paragraph>
              Your new business may begin with an idea or opportunity, but to really get it off the ground, you must go through legal business formation. There are several options when forming a business, including partnerships and limited liability corporations (LLCs). We will go over your business plan with you and help you understand which business formation makes the most sense for you and your partners.
