# Vercel Deployment - Dependency Fix

## Issue
When deploying to Vercel, the following dependency conflict error occurred:

```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error
npm error While resolving: @mui/base@5.0.0-beta.37
npm error Found: @types/react@19.1.3
npm error node_modules/@types/react
npm error   dev @types/react@"^19.1.3" from the root project
...
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peerOptional @types/react@"^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from @mui/base@5.0.0-beta.37
```

## Solution
The main issue was that `@mui/base@5.0.0-beta.37` is only compatible with `@types/react@^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`, but the project was using `@types/react@19.1.3`.

Fixed by updating these dependencies:

1. Changed `@mui/base` from version `5.0.0-beta.37` to `5.0.0-beta.38`
2. Downgraded `@types/react` from `^19.1.3` to `^18.2.66`
3. Downgraded `@types/react-dom` from `^19.1.3` to `^18.2.22`

## Deployment Steps After Fix

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub

1. Create a GitHub repository:
```bash
# If you need to create a new repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tickle-law.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. In the Vercel dashboard:
   - Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
   - Connect to the GitHub repository
   - Use default settings and deploy

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

1. Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

2. Deploy the project
```bash
vercel
```

3. For production deployment
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Avoiding Similar Issues

To prevent similar dependency conflicts in the future:

1. Use more specific version ranges in package.json
2. Regularly update dependencies with `npm update`
3. Run `npm ls @types/react` before deployment to check for conflicts
4. Consider using a tool like `npm-check-updates` to safely manage dependency updates
